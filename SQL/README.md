# Online Application #

A long while ago, I was going to re-write our online application for the college website - [the old
website, that is](http://legacy.stlchristian.edu).

This was my start at setting up the database. The structure is all here, if I remember correctly.

This particular application was doomed to fizzle in the light of other pressing matters. We ended up
redesigning our website along the way, and someday (pie in the sky) we'll have this running through
our SIS anyway.

So, this particular custom application went the way of the dinosaur, but maybe it will help you one
day.
